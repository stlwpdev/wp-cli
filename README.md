May-2014 Meetup - "wp-cli"
==========================

Some useful links mentioned in the talk:
* Vagrant - http://vagrantup.com/
* Virtual Box - https://www.virtualbox.org/
* VagrantPress - http://vagrantpress.org/
* VVV (Varying Vagrant Vagrants) - https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV

Both VVV and VagrantPress address the same question - **given a virtual machine (Vagrant / VirtualBox) how can I build a viable WordPress development environment?**  

For the presentation about WP-CLI I opted to use VagrantPress.

I wrote a detailed "how to" document on how to get WordPress Multisite running in VagrantPress - https://github.com/chad-thompson/vagrantpress/wiki/HOWTO:-WordPress-Multisite-in-VagrantPress
